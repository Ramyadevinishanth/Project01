# Project01
This project collects data from the Harvard Art Museums API, cleans and organizes it, and stores it in a database. I built an interactive Streamlit app that lets users explore,  filter and add artifacts to the database easily. The project uses Python and SQL to easily explore and understand the artifact collections.
